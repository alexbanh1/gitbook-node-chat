# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is where a huge amount of open source code resides. Almost every software developer (whether they are Web, mobile, desktop or other) has a GitHub account these days. It also has some great developer workflow features. 

You will need to sign up for a GitHub account. If you already have one, please sign in.

# Git

GitHub is centered around an open source Version Control System (VCS) called Git.

It's like Dropbox for coders. We need to make sure our project codebase is synced to a central server not only for backup purposes but also to share with other devs working on the same project. 

It gives us a lot more control than Dropbox though, and is not nearly as easy to use. That said, it's probably the most popular VCS today and continues to grow at a rapid pace, thanks to services like GitHub especially. 

If you were developing today's app on your own machine, you'd be installing Git. We've saved you that trouble, so no action required here.

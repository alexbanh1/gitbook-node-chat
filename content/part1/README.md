# Part I

## HTML and CSS

While this workshop is meant to teach you Javascript we have prepared a short sequence of exercises that will give you basic concepts about building the front-end to your web application.

* [HTML](html.md)
* [Dev Tools](dev-tools.md)
* [CSS](css.md)
* [CSS \(Example\)](final-css.md)

After that, it is time to dive into [JavaScript](../part2/README.md)

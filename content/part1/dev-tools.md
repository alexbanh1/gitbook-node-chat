# Dev Tools

With your ugly white page open, right click somewhere on the page (anywhere, really) and you'll notice an inspect element option.

Clicking that unlocks a most powerful yet kind-of secret feature that all major browsers have: **Dev Tools** (aka a Web Inspector).

Hover over the HTML source code shown and notice that you can not only use it to inspect the page, but you can also edit it right there (double click the code) to see how it affects the page.

Our browser gives us a live editor! Why? It's specifically there for developers to inspect _any_ page on the internet, to see how its HTML (and other things) are written.

By the way, any changes you make through this editor are just experiments and won't actually "stick". If you refresh the page the changes go away. They don't save into your source code directly.

Play around with it a bit more to get the hang of the "Elements" tab in the Dev Tools.

Then select (click) the `<body>` tag and on the right side you'll see something like this.

And what if I double click inside those weird sideways mustaches and type in the following.

That, my friend, was CSS.
